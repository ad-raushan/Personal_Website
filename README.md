This is like kind of my personal website or you could say something like that.
The website is gonna be improved on a regular basis.
You could check my socials, my pics taken by me (not that good onesðŸ˜…), my certifications (I'm not into certification things, it's just like showing off but I think doing is more learning than having a certification), also you could get my resume from the pages.
You could go to the wesite from the link in the description of the repository of this.

Give suggestions for the improvement of the website, as I'm new into this.
You could contact me through the mail on the website.

Have a good day :)
