            This was a project from my second semester of the college where I just casually made this Website.
            <br>
            Actually it was just a thing which we all students from our batch had to do and also this was compulsory.
            This was made in just 2 days so obviously it's not a working one and I never tried to modify it yet.
            <br>
            So, if you will go to this website it will just do the functions at the time of surfing but nothing will happen in reality.
